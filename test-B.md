## Test B

### Objectives

The objective of Test B is a summative assessment of your understanding of the course material for the _final 6 lectures_ of the course.
I will not ask detailed questions about the guest lecture (lecture 9).

### Dataframes

From lecture 8, I will assume familiarity with the Dataframe API and its advantages over plain RDDs, and that you grasped the essence of [assignment 3](assignments/A3-spark.html).
Knowledge of spark.ML and MLLib is not necessary.

### Data structures and Algorithms

Lecture 10 covers Inverted Files as a data structure, and lectures 12 and 13 introduced Locality Sensitive Hashing.

### Dimensionality reduction

Lectures 11 and 12 introduced the topic of dimensionality reduction, and specifically looked into SVD and CUR.

### Course Information

The main source to study is the series of slides for the lectures, in combination with the following background material:

- Chapter 4 "Inverted Indexing" in Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce, by Jimmy Lin and Chris Dyer 
([online version](https://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/ed1n.html)).
- The chapter on [Dimensionality Reduction](https://blackboard.ru.nl/bbcswebdav/pid-2489796-dt-content-rid-7055004_4/xid-7055004_4) in [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/), by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman
- The chapter on [Locality Sensitive Hashing](https://blackboard.ru.nl/bbcswebdav/pid-2439395-dt-content-rid-6830516_4/xid-6830516_4) in [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/), by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, Jeff Ullman
The exam material consists of only the Jaccard related material, i.e., Chapter 3 until (inclusive) section 3.4, pp 73-92.
