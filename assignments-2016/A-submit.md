## Submitting a completed assignment

1. You receive the invitation to create a repository for the assignment via Blackboard.
- _Take for example one of the students, `tjvoncken`, who accepted assignment 1A `test-blog`.
Upon accepting the assignment, the Github tooling for the classroom automatically created 
repository [rubigdata/test-blog-tjvoncken](https://github.com/rubigdata/test-blog-tjvoncken)._

1. You write your blog post in Markdown, and use `git` to publish the results to the repository.
- Make sure to push to branch `gh-pages`!
- _When `tjvoncken` pushes his assignment repository to branch `gh-pages`, the site gets automatically 
rendered and you find the results at 
[rubigdata.github.io/test-blog-tjvoncken/](http://rubigdata.github.io/test-blog-tjvoncken/)._
