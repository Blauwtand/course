# Blogging Setup 

## Content over layout

Grading this course will not take into account how beautiful results of the work are formatted.
We more easily focus on content by using **Markdown**, an increasingly popular language used to document code and/or write blogs published on the web.

Markdown is convenient as a tool to publish on the web, *especially* when used in combination with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and [git](http://git-scm.com). Equating webpages to files in a GitHub repository means that we edit and publish a website the exact same way as we version our code:
`git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` the website, *collaboratively and versioned*. When setup correctly, a tool called *Jekyll* will 
automagically convert the markdown into HTML.

## Github for Education

Did you already request your github student pack?
Please go to [github for education](https://education.github.com/pack/join) to get benefits like private repositories.

## How to setup your environment

Original instructions: [simple site](http://kbroman.org/simple_site/).

Once you have your first repository with a simple site to just testify success, 
you will use it as an even quicker starting point to bootstrap new repositories for completing the subsequent course assignments.
