## Content over layout

Grading this course will not take into account how beautiful results of the work are formatted.
We more easily focus on content by using **Markdown**, an increasingly popular language used to document code and/or write blogs published on the web.

Markdown is convenient as a tool to publish on the web, *especially* when used in combination with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and [git](http://git-scm.com). Equating webpages to files in a GitHub repository means that we edit and publish a website the exact same way as we version our code:
`git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` the website, *collaboratively and versioned*. When setup correctly, a tool called *Jekyll* will 
automagically convert the markdown into HTML.

## Github for Education

Did you already request your github student pack?
Please go to [github for education](https://education.github.com/pack/join) to get benefits like private repositories.

If you are not yet fluent in `git` and Github, then go ahead and study the 
[online training material](https://help.github.com/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources/)
provided by Github. If you are unhappy working with the command line (*a skill which I do recommend taking the 
effort to acquire*), consider Github's [OS X](http://mac.github.com) or [Windows](http://windows.github.com)
tool suites (the Windows one *is* convenient).

## How to Create a Blog Post

After familiarizing yourself with `git` (or refreshing your memory) with the resources above, continue to write a 
mockup blog post in Markdown syntax, as a model of the process of creating the results of an assignment.

Follow this link to the *Classroom for Github* [**Bigdata Blog 2018** assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/xpbKPce6), login with your github account, and accept the assignment.

This creates a private repository under the `rubigdata` "organization", specifically for this assignment. 
This newly created repository `rubigdata/bigdata-blog-2018-USERNAME` will contain an example blogpost in the `README.md` file. 

In order to publish this page go to your Github repository on [Github](https://github.com) and go to the settings tab. Scroll down to the **Github Pages** settings and select `master` as source to enable Github pages. After a little delay your repository should appear on `rubigdata.github.io/bigdata-blog-2018-USERNAME`.

## Editting the Blog post

Now in order to add your own content you must `clone` the private repository and edit the contents of `README.md`  

## Finalize the test assignment
The goal in this first assignment is to just complete your first repository that contains a simple site, 
composed in Markdown, published online for free; with no actual content, just to make sure the process is familiar.
You can use the results of this template as your own **simple site**, and deploy the same steps in the rest 
of the course to bootstrap new blog posts, one for every *real* course assignment.
