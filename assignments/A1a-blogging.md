# Blogging Setup 

## Content over layout

Grading this course will not take into account how beautiful results of the work are formatted.
We more easily focus on content by using **Markdown**, an increasingly popular language used to document code and/or write blogs published on the web.

Markdown is convenient as a tool to publish on the web when used in combination with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and [git](http://git-scm.com).
Equating a webpage to a GitHub repository allows to edit pages with `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`, collaboratively and versioned.
When setup correctly, *Jekyll* will automagically convert your markdown into HTML.

## How to setup your enviornment

Original instructions: [simple site](http://kbroman.org/simple_site/).

Once you have your first repository with a simple site to just testify success, 
you will use it as an even quicker starting point to bootstrap new repositories for completing the subsequent course assignments.
