# Docker Environment

## Introduction

We will use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/linux/) to remove the burden on unifying working environments.

First, go over the [quickstart](https://docs.docker.com/engine/quickstart/) to gain familiarity with Docker usage.

You use Docker on the computers in the terminal room. 
Alternatively, install Docker on your own laptop or home computer.
While this is **not supported**, I do provide [basic advice](../pages/docker.html) to get you started.
