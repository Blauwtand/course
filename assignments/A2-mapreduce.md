## Map Reduce on HDFS

Lectures 3 to 5 discussed distributed filesystems and Map-Reduce, that in practice today are almost equivalent to "Hadoop".

In this assignment, we install Hadoop on our own "pseudo-cluster", and use Map-Reduce to do some basic count operations.

The tutorial was tested inside the Docker container for Spark-Notebook that we setup in the previous lab sessions;
you would use the `docker exec` command to start a shell inside the image first.
The HDFS filesystem that you create and use in this tutorial, can be re-used in the later lab sessions on Spark.

### Setup

Setup distributed filesystem `HDFS` and the Map-Reduce tools using [these Hadoop instructions](../background/hadoop.html).

### Blog post

The assignment is to write a blog post about your experience with HDFS and Map-Reduce.

Assume the reader knows what a distributed filesystem is, and why you would use it.

Copy the *Complete Shakespeare* in text provided at 
[`/vol/practica/BigData/100.txt.utf-8`](file:///vol/practica/BigData/100.txt.utf-8)
into directory `/mnt/bigdata` in the docker container.

Walk your readers through a simple Map-Reduce example to count the number of lines, words or characters 
(or something more interesting, it is really up to you).

Address at least the following questions:
+ What happens when you ran the commands in the _Standalone_ part of the tutorial?
+ What is different in the _Pseudo-Distributed_ case?
  How can we see that it is different from the generated output?
+ How do you use mapreduce to count the number of lines/words/characters/... in the *Complete Shakespeare*?
+ Does Romeo or Juliet appear more often in the plays?
  Can you answer this question making only one pass over the corpus?

If things go smooth, try to compute the average number of words or characters per line.

If things go _really_ smoothly, you can try to use a combiner and discuss the improvement achieved.
