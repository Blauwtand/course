# Practical Assignments

## Objectives

The practical work for the course serves two main objectives:
1. Get to know the emerging Big Data platforms in more detail by using them, with a focus on data analysis using Spark.
2. Gain hands-on experience using modern development tools and services, including `git`, `github`, `docker`, `Jupyter notebooks`, *etc.*.

## Piazza

Cluster computing is a dynamic field characterized by continuous developments.
Many tools are not as robust as they should be!
We should expect many surprises and puzzling issues to arise during practical work for the course.
Please help each other!

[Sign up](https://piazza.com/ru.nl/spring2016/nwiibc036) to Piazza and help each other during practical work.
Feel free to ask for help, with any type of problem - whether it being a deep technical issue, or just the question "how did I again set my ssh key",
using your own name and account, or anonymously if you prefer.
The forum works best if we use it actively!

## Completing and Evaluating Assignments

In this course, we use *Github for education* to hand in **brief** reports (say, *blogs*) about the practical work.
Standard git functionality serves perfectly for carrying out peer review, and keeping track of modifications in response to feedback.

Refer to [assignment 1](assignments/A1a-blogging.html) for more details.
