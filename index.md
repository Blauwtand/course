## Practical Assignments

### Objectives

The practical work for the course serves two main objectives:

1. Get to know the emerging Big Data platforms in more detail by using them, with a focus on data analysis using Spark.
2. Gain hands-on experience using modern development tools and services, including `git`, `github`, `docker`, `Jupyter notebooks`, *etc.*.

### Completing and Evaluating Assignments

In this course, we use *Github for education* to hand in **brief** reports (like a blog post) about the results of the 
practical work. Standard git functionality serves perfectly for carrying out peer review, and keeping track of 
modifications in response to feedback.

Refer to [assignment 1a](assignments/A1a-blogging.html) for more details about the blogging framework.

### Getting help
Check out the [forum](https://github.com/rubigdata/forum-2018) to get help, or even help out your peers.
If you feel the forum is not the right place for your question you can contact one of the student assistents at
`wietse.kuipers AT student.ru.nl` or `J.martens AT student.ru.nl`

### Development environment

Development environment customization: more next week.

### Assignments Schedule

#### February 21st: Setup and first test blog

Completing the first assignment is not evaluated. However, I expect that every student will be able 
to create their assignment reports in Markdown and have these converted to HTML at their github page,
and know how to start Spark Notebook on their hardware of choice (be it a laptop, their home computer or
a PC in HG 00.137).
